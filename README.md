Which algorithm you got better accuracy? Can you justify why?

The Glass dataset has characteristics that make it more suitable for the Linear SVM algorithm as compared to the Naive Bayes Algorithm. The Linear SVM algorithm excels when the data has clear linear separability, which is the case with the Glass dataset. Conversely, the Naive Bayes Algorithm is a probabilistic classifier that works well with simple datasets and when features are conditionally independent given the class. However, the Glass dataset has linear separation between classes, which is why the Linear SVM algorithm performed better. The Linear SVM algorithm does not make strong assumptions about feature independence, unlike the Naive Bayes Algorithm, which assumes linear boundaries between classes. To determine the most effective algorithm for a particular problem, it is necessary to try out and compare the results of multiple machine learning models using different algorithms and techniques. The choice of algorithm should be based on the characteristics of the dataset and the specific requirements of the problem.
